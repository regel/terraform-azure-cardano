## How to use this Module

This repo has the following folder structure:

* [modules](https://github.com/regel/terraform-azure-cardano/tree/main/modules): This folder contains several standalone, reusable, production-grade modules that you can use to deploy the application.
* [examples](https://github.com/regel/terraform-azure-cardano/tree/main/examples): This folder shows examples of different ways to combine the modules in the `modules` folder to deploy the application.

## What's a Module?

A Module is a canonical, reusable, best-practices definition for how to run a single piece of infrastructure, such 
as a database or server cluster. Each Module is created using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), and
includes automated tests, examples, and documentation. It is maintained both by the open source community and 
companies that provide commercial support. 

Instead of figuring out the details of how to run a piece of infrastructure from scratch, you can reuse 
existing code that has been proven in production. And instead of maintaining all that infrastructure code yourself, 
you can leverage the work of the Module community to pick up infrastructure improvements through
a version number bump.
 
## Code included in this Module:

* [cluster](https://github.com/regel/terraform-azure-cardano/tree/main/modules/cluster): This module installs a Kubernetes cluster in Azure and network security plugins
* [helm-cardano](https://github.com/regel/terraform-azure-cardano/tree/main/modules/helm-cardano): This module installs Kubernetes Helm releases
* [vault](https://github.com/regel/terraform-azure-cardano/tree/main/modules/vault): This module configures an Azure Key Vault and network ACLs


## How do I contribute to this Module?

Contributions are very welcome! Check out the [Contribution Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions.


## How is this Module versioned?

This Module follows the principles of [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). You can find each new release, 
along with the changelog, in the [Releases Page](../../releases). 

During initial development, the major version will be 0 (e.g., `0.x.y`), which indicates the code does not yet have a 
stable API. 

## How do I find the Blockchain snapshot

Cardano blockchain snapshots are updated daily. The URL of the snapshot can be set in `pvc_source_url` variable. 

testnet:

```
echo $(curl -s https://downloads.csnapshots.io/snapshots/testnet/testnet-db-snapshot.json| jq -r .[].file_name ) 
```

mainnet:

```
echo $(curl -s https://downloads.csnapshots.io/snapshots/mainnet/mainnet-db-snapshot.json| jq -r .[].file_name ) 
```
